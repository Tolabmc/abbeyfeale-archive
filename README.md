# Abbeyfeale Archives
Abbeyfeale archives is a community history project to help preserve historical documents that have been given to me by my Grand Aunt who is a local historian in the town of Abbeyfeale.
The project is a digitisation of these documents that had been collected over the past 60 years. I hope to help preserve these documents and the history connected to them by making them widely accessible through this site.
